# ship-note v0.1.5 shipped

## What shipped
- Added short-preset low-signal filtering to reduce release/admin noise in generated updates.
- Added `--keep-low-signal` to opt out when those commits should be included.
- Expanded tests and CLI docs for the new behavior.

## Why it matters
- `short` mode now produces cleaner update snippets by default.
- Keeps control explicit when a release note needs full administrative context.

## Validation
- Tests: 13 passed (`PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q`)
- Preflight: 18 pass, 0 warn, 0 fail (strict profile)
