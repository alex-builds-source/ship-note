# ship-note v0.1.0 shipped

## What shipped
- Bootstrapped a focused CLI tool for generating release/devlog drafts from git history.
- Added `ship-note draft` with range controls: `--since-tag`, `--since-commit`, default latest tag to `HEAD`.
- Added deterministic markdown sections: Title, What shipped, Why it matters, Validation, Links.
- Added changelog enrichment by merging `CHANGELOG.md` bullets into `What shipped`.
- Added `--output` to write drafts directly to a file.

## Why it matters
- Turns release communication from a manual writing task into a repeatable one-command flow.
- Keeps devlogs consistent and agent-friendly while still readable by humans.

## Validation
- Tests: 6 passed (`PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q`)
- Preflight: 18 pass, 0 warn, 0 fail (strict profile)
