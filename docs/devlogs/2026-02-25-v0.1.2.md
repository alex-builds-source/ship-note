# ship-note v0.1.2 shipped

## What shipped
- Added scope filters for commit selection:
  - `--include-scope` (repeatable)
  - `--exclude-scope` (repeatable)
- Improved changelog enrichment to read bullets from the latest changelog section first.
- Added fallback behavior for changelogs without section headers.
- Ignored nested changelog bullets to keep generated drafts concise.

## Why it matters
- Draft output is easier to target by area (API/UI/etc.) and less noisy in mixed changelog formats.
- Dogfooding quality improved for real release notes.

## Validation
- Tests: 9 passed (`PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q`)
- Preflight: 18 pass, 0 warn, 0 fail (strict profile)
