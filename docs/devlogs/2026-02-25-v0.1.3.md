# ship-note v0.1.3 shipped

## What shipped
- Added output presets for draft generation:
  - `--preset standard` for fuller release-note output
  - `--preset short` for concise updates
- Presets now set practical defaults for title and section verbosity while still allowing explicit flags.
- Expanded tests and docs for preset behavior.

## Why it matters
- Produces better-fit drafts for different delivery surfaces (quick chat updates vs full release notes).
- Reduces manual post-processing when publishing updates.

## Validation
- Tests: 10 passed (`PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q`)
- Preflight: 18 pass, 0 warn, 0 fail (strict profile)
