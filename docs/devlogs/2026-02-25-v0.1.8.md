# ship-note v0.1.8 shipped

## What shipped
- Refined short-mode low-signal fallback heuristics.
- When all in-range commits are filtered as low-signal, stale changelog carryover is now suppressed.
- When no changelog context exists, low-signal commits are retained to avoid empty draft output.
- Expanded tests and docs for this behavior.

## Why it matters
- Short updates stay concise without drifting into stale or misleading summaries.
- Edge-case behavior remains deterministic and explicit.

## Validation
- Tests: 16 passed (`PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q`)
- Preflight: 18 pass, 0 warn, 0 fail (strict profile)
