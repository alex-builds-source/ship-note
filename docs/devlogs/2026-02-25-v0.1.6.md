# ship-note v0.1.6 shipped

## What shipped
- Refined short-mode low-signal fallback behavior.
- When low-signal commit filtering removes everything, drafts now prefer changelog bullets if available.
- If no changelog context exists, commit bullets are retained to avoid empty output.
- Expanded tests and CLI docs for this behavior.

## Why it matters
- Short updates stay concise without accidentally dropping all meaningful content.
- Edge-case behavior is now deterministic and test-backed.

## Validation
- Tests: 15 passed (`PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q`)
- Preflight: 18 pass, 0 warn, 0 fail (strict profile)
