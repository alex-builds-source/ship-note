# ship-note v0.1.9

## What shipped
- Expanded short-preset low-signal filtering heuristics to suppress common release-maintenance noise.
  - `docs:` commits mentioning `devlog`, `release notes`, or `changelog`
  - `chore:` commits mentioning release/version/dependency/changelog maintenance terms
- Added regression coverage for dependency-chore filtering in short mode.
- Added version-consistency test to keep `pyproject.toml` and package `__version__` aligned.

## Why it matters
- Short-mode updates stay focused on user-visible work instead of release housekeeping noise.
- Package metadata is now less likely to drift across repeated releases.

## Validation
- `PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q` → `18 passed`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python -m repo_preflight.cli check --path . --strict --compact` → `pass=18 warn=0 fail=0`
- `gitleaks git --redact` → no leaks found
