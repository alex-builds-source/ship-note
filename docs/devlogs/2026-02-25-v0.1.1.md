# ship-note v0.1.1 shipped

## What shipped
- Added commit-type filtering flags to `ship-note draft`:
  - `--include-type` (repeatable)
  - `--exclude-type` (repeatable)
- Added scope-aware grouping with `--group-by scope` for commits like `feat(api): ...`.
- Added template customization knobs:
  - `--title-template`
  - `--no-validation`
  - `--no-links`
- Expanded CLI docs and tests for the new ergonomics.

## Why it matters
- Makes generated drafts easier to tailor for different release audiences and channels.
- Improves signal-to-noise by letting you focus on the commit types and sections you want.

## Validation
- Tests: 8 passed (`PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q`)
- Preflight: 18 pass, 0 warn, 0 fail (strict profile)
