# ship-note v0.1.4 shipped

## What shipped
- Added explicit output caps:
  - `--max-bullets`
  - `--max-changelog-items`
- Added normalization-based dedupe between commit and changelog bullets.
- Tightened `short` preset defaults for cleaner concise updates.
- Expanded tests/docs for quality-tuning behavior.

## Why it matters
- Reduces repetitive noise in generated drafts.
- Gives tighter control for chat-sized outputs while keeping full-note mode flexible.

## Validation
- Tests: 12 passed (`PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q`)
- Preflight: 18 pass, 0 warn, 0 fail (strict profile)
